# Grandmas Recipies
## Team 4 Final Project

1. Please clone the project using the following command: 
`git clone https://github.com/rbridge1104byui/CSE341-Final_project.git`

1. Open the project directory in your text editor. Then switch to the `dev` branch by using the text editor's GUI or by entering the following command in the terminal: `git checkout dev`

1. From the `dev` branch, create a feature branch including your first name (replace "my-feature" with a simple name for what you are working on): `git branch chris-my-feature`

1. Switch to your new branch: `git checkout [branch name]`

1. Or do it all in one command (this creates a new branch and switches to it at the same time): `git checkout -b [branch name]`

1. Send your newly created branch to the remote repository so you can push to it: `git push origin [branch name]`

1. Get to work! Commit your changes often with the following commands:
`git add .`
`git commit -m "My detailed commit message"`

1. Always `pull` from `dev` before starting your work and again before pushing your changes: `git pull origin dev`

1. You can also run `git fetch` to see all changes to the repository.

1. At any time, use `git status` for hints on what needs to be done next.

1. Finally, run `git push` to send your work to the remote repository.
